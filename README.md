# Digital Electronics - D-Flip-Flop
## About:
<p>This project was built along with the Laboratory Digital Electronics at the Technical University of Applied Sciences of Regensburg (OTH Regensburg), Bavaria, Germany. The simulation of the D-Flip-Flop with AMD Vivado is the focus of the project.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a truth table summarizing the operation of a D flip-flop with just D as an input and the clock signal CLK:</p>

## Simulation:
<p>After creating a testbench for this project, you can see how the output Q (as digital signal) changes when the rising edge of the clock comes and gets the value of the signal D.</p>
